  Needed to use a Cheat-sheet to get it to work. An old folder with code already in it didn't I get to work.
  Cheat-sheet: http://www.notyourdadsit.com/blog/2018/4/3/cheatsheet-setup-github-on-visual-studio-code
  Tried to move a file to Folder_In_Workspace, 'stage change', 'commit' and remote push to github. WORKED!
  
  Will try with my project now: CGFRoute
